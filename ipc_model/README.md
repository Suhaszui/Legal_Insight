⚙️ Why Linear SVC performs better

Linear SVC is designed for high-dimensional, sparse data like TF-IDF vectors.

It maximizes the margin between classes, making it more robust to overlapping text patterns.

Naive Bayes relies on a strong independence assumption, which is unrealistic for legal language.

Logistic Regression is sensitive to class imbalance and does not separate classes as effectively as SVC in this setting.
